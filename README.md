# bigquery-bikes
Ford GoBike is interested in deciding what kinds of promotions to offer through its mobile app. The focus is on commuter trips because those likely contribute the most revenue to the company and, if new customers are generated, they will likely yield consistent revenue for a longer period of time because they will 1) sign up for longer subscriptions and 2) need the service on a daily basis.

The jupyter notebook in this repository is a short report that uses Google BigQuery to extract GoBike data, explores the data to find answers to key questions, and gives recommendations based on the exploration.
